Concentration Demo
1. rename @IBOutlet name of var
2. use Outlet Collections
3. static func xxx()->Int {..} ,
    A static function is a function, even though it's in the class, you can't send it to a instance class. A instance class not understand 		 this message. What understand message is a type class
4. var game = Concentration(numberOfPairsOfCards: (cardButtons.count + 1) / 2)
	Cannot use instance member 'cardButtons' within property initializer; property initializers run before 'self' is available.
	lazy , if you make a var lazy that means it doesn't actually initialize until someone grabs.
